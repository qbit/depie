# depie

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qbit/depie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qbit/depie)

A tool that attempts install 3rd party dependencies so you don't have
to!

There is a lot of duplicated work/code going into native node modules. This
work could be entirely mitigated if node modules used OS packaging
systems which have, for the most part, already built these dependencies.
